# Neural-Style-Transfer-Art-AI
Neural Style Transfer implementation using a pretrained VGG network to blend content and artistic style images through optimized content and style loss functions.
# Neural Style Transfer – Art & AI (2023)

## Overview
This project implements Neural Style Transfer (NST) to generate artistic images by combining the content of one image with the style of another using deep learning techniques.

## What I Implemented
- Designed a Neural Style Transfer (NST) system to combine content and artistic style images
- Implemented content loss and style loss
- Used a pretrained VGG network for feature extraction
- Optimized the model to balance content preservation and artistic style generation

## Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Pretrained VGG Network

## Implementation
The complete implementation is available in the Jupyter notebook:
- `NST.ipynb`

## Project Type
Academic / Learning Project
